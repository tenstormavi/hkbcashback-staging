<h1>Encashmore.com - Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
<p><strong>1. Membership:<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Encashmore.com membership is available through  registration process after you submit certain requested information to us. If you register with  Encashmore.com it is assumed that you have read and agree with the Terms of  Service. <br />
  Please be aware that a  member of Encashmore.com is not allowed to run any paid ads on Google, Facebook  or any other platform pointing to Encashmore.com. If the member does not comply  with this then it would result in immediate termination of his/her  account.&nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. </strong><strong>Cashback Service:</strong><br />
  <br />
  Our Cashback Service allows users who register on the Site (&quot;<strong>Members</strong>&quot;)  and therefore create an account with us (&quot;<strong>Account</strong>&quot;) to earn  cashback on tracked purchases from retailers on the Site (&quot;<strong>Retailers</strong>&quot;).  To qualify for cashback, the Retailer must confirm that the Member's purchase  is tracked, genuine and successful (constituting a &quot;<strong>Qualifying  Transaction</strong>&quot;), and your resulting cashback must be received by us  (becoming &quot;<strong>Cashback</strong>&quot; as a result).<br />
  <br />
  <strong>3. Becoming a Member:</strong><br />
  <br />
  You must be at least 16 years of age to become a  Member.<br />
  You must register for the Cashback Service using accurate and current  information about yourself - including your correct name, address and any other  requested details. If you are asked for, and provide, details of a bank account  or Cheque payment details into which you wish to receive payments you (a) must  ensure that you are, and remain, fully entitled to use that Cashback Receipt  Method, and (b) confirm that you wish to receive cashback through that Cashback  Receipt Method. You should keep this information updated through your Account.<br />
  <br />
  Note that your Cashback  Receipt Method (such as NEFT or Cheque) may have rules about the maximum or  minimum payment that you can receive through that Cashback Receipt Method.<br />
  <br />
Important: You must ensure that the email address we hold for you is kept  up-to-date and that you have full access to it - we will be sending you  important messages there. If you change email address, then you must change the  address we hold for you on your Account.</p>
<p><strong>4. Cashback </strong></p>
<p>After a Member successfully  completes a Qualifying Transaction, and once we have received the resulting  Cashback for that Qualifying Transaction, we pass that Cashback to the Member  through his/her Cashback Receipt Method.<br />
  <br />
  Please note that there are various circumstances in which a transaction with a  Retailer may not constitute a Qualifying Transaction, or Cashback may not  result from it. This is also true for a Qualifying Referral. The Member  understands that all transactions made by him/her are not with us, but with the  individual Retailer. Further, from time to time Retailers may increase or  decrease the commission paid – in which case the cashback offer illustrated on  our Site may be incorrect. By default, your applicable transactions will be  credited in line with the commission reported to us by the Retailer, which may  be more or less than the advertised rate. We shall not be liable for any  difference in the expected cashback by the Member and the actual Cashback  received by the Member.<br />
  <br />
  When we have traced a paying, Qualifying Transaction to your Account, we will  credit your Account with a 'pending payment'. Once the Retailer confirms the  transaction, the payment will be marked as 'validated' – this can take 90 days  or more from the date of the purchase. If the goods are returned or the sale  reversed or amended by any means then the cashback payment will not be made.  Further, in the event that the Retailer feels that the purchase is not genuine  for any reason whatsoever and we do not receive any Cashback for the  transaction, the Member will not receive any Cashback.<br />
  <br />
  Whether a transaction shall qualify as a Qualifying for cashback Transaction  (including cashback through a Qualifying Referral) shall be at the sole  discretion of the Retailer or us and the Member understands and agrees to the  same. We shall not be held responsible if the Retailer fails to report a sale  to us or does not qualify a transaction as Qualifying Transaction. Further, we  shall not be responsible in the event due to some technical or other error we  cannot trace a sale back to the Member and does not qualify the transaction as  a Qualifying Transaction or a Qualifying Referral for any reason whatsoever.  Whilst we will endeavour to recuperate non-payments from the Retailer, the  decision of ourselves, the Retailer or Retailer's tracking agent is final.  Whilst we will try and recuperate missing commissions, at any point we reserve  the right not to chase missing commission claims, particularly where no  purchase has been made.<br />
  <br />
  When a Member sends us an enquiry on missing cashback, our system would check  if the user had an exit click from our site for that store on the date  mentioned by the user. If no exit clicks can be tracked then we will show a  message to the Member indicating that they did not click via our website to  earn cashback prior to the sale. All exit clicks to stores are saved in the  database for cross reference on adding cashback values. Where a commission  enquiry has been successfully paid by a Retailer, you may receive a lower amount  than expected; this is due to the amounts received by ourselves possibly being  lower than the original claim. We do allow you to query this with us. If a  Retailer still hasn't paid a manual commission claim after a period of six  months then we reserve the right to close the enquiry claim.<br />
  <br />
  We reserve the right to reclaim or make balance adjustments accordingly where  it has been established that any credit has been applied in error. This will  include but is not limited to transactions where the credit is not genuinely  due or payment for any credited transaction has not been received from a  Retailer or its agencies and/or misuse or fraud. This can include transactions  which are already marked as payable or validated in your Account, or for  transactions which have already been paid over to you by [NEFT or Cheque] or  any other means.<br />
  <br />
  There are various circumstances in which Cashback will not be payable to the  Member, and will be forfeited to us, these could be, without limitation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>where the cashback payment that we receive is not attributed to a  Qualifying Transaction or associated with an Account (such as where the Member  is not logged-in to the our site when making the relevant purchase)</li>
  <li>the transaction to which the Cashback relates is cancelled after it has  been entered into (whether under the right of cancellation that applies to some  sales made at a distance, or otherwise) the Cashback is attributed to a Member  or Account that has been:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>suspended by  us under Clause 9 of this  Agreement or for any other reason;</li>
    <li>associated  with any fraudulent activity or any breach of this Agreement;</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p><br />
  <strong>5. Your Account:</strong><br />
  <br />
You  can withdraw your validated cashback when you have at least Rs 40 in your  Account. In the event the Member decides to close the Account with us or the  Member's Account is closed for any reason whatsoever, before reaching the  initial Rs 40 limit, there mind be a small transaction fee to withdraw the  cashback. Cashback payments by Cheque carry an additional fee of Rs 30. This is  charged by our Bank to cover administration and postage costs. We have the  discretion to forfeit any such validated balance showing on your Account for  the reasons provided elsewhere in this Agreement.The mode of payment is NEFT transfer or through cheque.</p>
